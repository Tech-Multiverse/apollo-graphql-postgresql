<h1> Apollo GraphQL with PostgreSQL</h1>

This repo provides a *docker-compose.yaml* that builds an Apollo Server and hosts GraphQL connected to a PostgreSQL database.

<strong>Everything is set up to automatically build and connect GraphQL to your database!</strong>

<u>All you have to do to get started is:</u>
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run `docker compose up` in your terminal.
4. Wait for everything to build.
5. Once you see `ðŸš€  Server ready at http://localhost:4000/` open a browser and navigate to that url.
6. Click the "Query your server" button.
7. Interact with GraphQL from Apollo Studio's sandbox.
8. Shut everything with Ctrl + C in the terminal where you started - or manually shut down the apollo-server container via docker.

<strong>Here are some examples you can use.</strong>

Validate the DB is connected by having it return a time with this query:
```
query ExampleQuery {
  hello
}
```

Add a user with this mutation:
```
mutation {
  addUser(name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com") {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

Get users from your database with this query:
```
query {
  getUsers {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}
```

<h2>Customize Your Data!</h2>

Once you're ready to customize your data, you'll want to do the following:

1. Create a .env file and define formal credentials as environment variables. I kept it this way for demo simplicity!

2. Add the SQL to auto create your desired tables in the *init-db.sh* script.

3. Define your schema and type definitions in *schema.graphql*

4. Define your resolvers to interact with PostgreSQL in *resolvers.js*

5. Have fun working with GraphQL and PostgreSQL!! ðŸ¥³
